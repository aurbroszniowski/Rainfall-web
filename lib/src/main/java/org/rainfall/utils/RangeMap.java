/**
 * A special Map, where keys are double values defining ranges.
 * E.g.
 *    map.put(0.10, "value1");
 *    map.put(0.20, "value2");
 *    map.put(0.15, "value3");
 *
 * The value1 can be fetched for a value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 0.10 (exclusive)
 *
 * Next, the lower value of the range is the higher value of the previous key (0.10), and the higher range will be the
 *   lower range value + the key value (0.10 + 0.20)
 * the value2 can be fetched for a key between 0.10 (inclusive) and 0.30 (exclusive).
 *
 * Next, the lower value of the range is the higher value of the previous key (0.30), and the higher range will be the
 *   lower range value + the key value (0.30 + 0.15)
 * the value3 can be fetched for a key between 0.30 (inclusive) and 0.45 (exclusive).
 *
 * Fetching a value for a key higher than 0.45 will return null
